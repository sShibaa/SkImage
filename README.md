# SkImage
Turn images to Minecraft skins!

Download:      [Sk-Image.jar](https://github.com/sShibaa/SkImage/blob/master/Sk-Image.jar?raw=true)

If the "Replace Selected File" button is left unchecked it will export the png with the name of the image with "_skin" at the end. It's completely up to you on whether you want this on or not.




THINGS TO KNOW:

If the program doesnt open, make sure you have Java installed.
If the program doesnt work properly, make sure your image is a png.
Another thing to note is the program will automatically scale the image to 32x32. So the closer the image is to 32x32, the better it will look. So in theory the higher quality base image is, the lower quality the new image will be.
There is a BIG chance this only works for Windows! I will most likely make a Linux version in the future.  I'm not sure if I have the stuff to make this compatibile for Mac but I will try.
